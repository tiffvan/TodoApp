# Todoaholic

This app provides a person a place to input tasks that they want to do at some point and mark them off, helping them not to forget all of them.

The process I took of making the app:
#1 Creating a basic Kotlin project in Android Studio
#2 Creating all the necessary files that I would need
#3 Creating an alert dialog where a person can enter the task that they need todo
#4 Created a list item on the main page
#5 Adding the todo items to the list using Sqlite database
#6 Changed the styling of the app to make it look more appealing

I think this app is successful because it achieves the task that it was created to do.
